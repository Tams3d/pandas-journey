# 🚀 Introduction

Welcome to `pandas-journey` — a personal, practical repository where I document everything I've learned while working with **Pandas**, one of the essential **tools** for working with data in Python.

This project follows my path from the basics of handling tabular data to more advanced workflows like **grouping**, **filtering**, **sorting**, and **merging** all while building a strong foundation in **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**.

Along the way, I used **Jupyter Notebooks** to experiment with ideas and explore patterns in the data. For visualization, I relied on **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to bring insights to life in a more intuitive way. To maintain clean, readable code, I used **Ruff** for linting and managed dependencies with **uv** to ensure a fast and reproducible environment.

This repo is part learning log, part personal reference — organized so others can follow along or revisit key topics at any time.

## 📦 Installation & Setup

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Tams3d/pandas-journey.git
  cd pandas-journey
  ```

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/Scripts/activate  # For Windows
# or
source .venv/bin/activate      # For macOS/Linux
```

3. Install dependencies

```bash
uv sync
```

This will install all required packages listed in the `pyproject.toml` file, including `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `ruff`, and other development dependencies.

## 📚 Topics Covered

This repository explores a wide range of practical Pandas features, including:

- Working with Series and DataFrames
- Reading and writing data (CSV, Excel, JSON)
- Modifying and updating elements
- Indexing, filtering, and sorting
- GroupBy operations and aggregations
- Merging and joining datasets
- Stacking, unstacking, and reshaping
- Handling missing data and outliers
- Time-based data and basic time series handling
- Building simple visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Real-world EDA techniques and workflow tips

## 🙋 About Me

I'm an 18-year-old with a strong interest in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science. I learn best through hands-on projects and real-world experimentation.
Beyond programming, I enjoy creative work like photo/video editing and 3D design in Blender, building tools to enhance these workflows by combining technical and creative thinking.

Currently, I'm focused on deep learning and generative AI, with a goal of contributing to research and open-source work.
This repository reflects my commitment to mastering core tools like Pandas as part of my foundation in scientific and AI computing.
