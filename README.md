## Overview

This repository documents everything I've learned while working with Pandas. Starting from the basics like Series and DataFrames, I gradually moved towards more complex topics like grouping, merging, and multi-index operations. Each notebook represents a specific topic explored in detail.

The core philosophy is learning by working with actual datasets, experimenting with different methods, and visualizing results using Matplotlib and Seaborn. I've used Ruff to maintain clean code and uv for efficient dependency management.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13 or above
- Git

### Setup

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tams3d/pandas-journey.git
cd pandas-journey
```

Create and activate a virtual environment (highly recommended):

```bash
python -m venv .venv

# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

This automatically installs pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, ruff, and all other dependencies specified in `pyproject.toml`.

## Topics Covered

### Fundamentals

- **Series Operations** - Creation, indexing, and basic operations
- **DataFrame Basics** - Structure, creation, and fundamental operations
- **Data Access** - Techniques for retrieving and filtering data

### Intermediate Techniques

- **Data Modification** - Updating, adding, and removing data
- **Built-in Methods** - Leveraging pandas' extensive method library
- **String Operations** - Text processing and manipulation

### Advanced Topics

- **GroupBy Operations** - Split-apply-combine workflows and aggregations
- **Merging DataFrames** - Joins, concatenation, and combining datasets
- **MultiIndex** - Working with hierarchical indices
- **Time Series** - Datetime handling and temporal analysis

### Visualization

- Creating plots with Matplotlib
- Statistical graphics with Seaborn
- Customizing visualizations for data presentation

## About

I'm 18 and deeply interested in AI, machine learning, and data science. I've realized that the best way to learn is by building things and experimenting with real problems rather than just reading theory.

Apart from programming, I enjoy creative work like photo and video editing, and 3D design using Blender. I often combine these creative interests with technical skills to build useful tools and workflows.

Right now, I'm focusing on deep learning and generative AI. My long-term goal is to contribute to research and open-source projects in the AI domain. This repository is part of building that foundation - understanding core tools like Pandas is essential for any serious work in data science or ML.
